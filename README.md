### Abstract
The PREVENT equation by the American Heart Association  incorporates traditional CVD risk factors, but it does not fully account for the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH). This study aims to evaluate the clinical implications of adding individual-level SDOH variables to the PREVENT equation to improve CVD risk prediction. Data from AHRQ will be examined to find geospatial correlations between SDOH and CVD. Following this, data from NHANES will be used to create a new PREVENT equation using the specific zip code results from the AHRQ analysis and machine learning methods. The findings aim to provide more personalized and equitable risk predictions, potentially advancing CVD prevention strategies.
